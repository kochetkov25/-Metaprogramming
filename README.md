# C++ Metaprogramming Tasks (Stepik)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of C++ tasks focused on **metaprogramming**, a powerful technique in C++ that allows for compile-time computations. The solutions cover a wide range of fundamental problems related to writing metafunctions and demonstrate the usage of template metaprogramming to solve complex tasks in an efficient manner. 

Metaprogramming enables developers to write flexible and reusable code, allowing for computations that would otherwise require runtime execution. By leveraging templates, these tasks provide insights into compile-time programming, optimizations, and how to work with the C++ type system.
